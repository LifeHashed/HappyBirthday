    <p>Dear Ritaja,</p> 
    <p>Happy Birthday, my love! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚ðŸ’– On this special day, I want to take a moment to celebrate the incredible person you are and express my deepest gratitude for having you in my life.<br>

From the moment we met, each day has been brighter and more beautiful because of you. Your kindness, warmth, and laughter fill my world with joy. As you add another candle to your cake, remember that you are not just getting older; you're becoming even more extraordinary.<br>

May this year bring you countless moments of happiness, new adventures, and the realization of your dreams. You deserve all the love and success life has to offer.<br>

Thank you for being my partner in crime, my confidante, and my greatest source of inspiration. I look forward to creating many more wonderful memories together.<br>

Here's to celebrating you today and always, my love! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽˆ<br>

With all my love,<br></p>
